## Project: Resin Management
The objective of this website is to assist individuals who play multiple gacha games in remembering to log in and utilize their resin. Since each gacha game has a different time to fulfill the resin, it can be challenging to keep track of which game is close to reaching fullness. The idea behind this website is to help players manage their resin across several games without losing any resin.
